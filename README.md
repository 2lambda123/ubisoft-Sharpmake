# Sharpmake [![build status](https://gitlab-ncsa.ubisoft.org/alexandrie/sharpmake/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab-ncsa.ubisoft.org/alexandrie/sharpmake/commits/master)


## Introduction

Sharpmake is a solution to generate Visual Studio project files for C++, C#, VSIX, as well as FastBuild bff files, and linux makefiles.

It is similar to Premake, but in C#. Originally developed on AC3 in 2011,
it is used by most projects within Ubisoft.

Note: Sharpmake was presented at UDC. You can go directly at 18:00
in http://ubitube/Movie.aspx?movieID=4936. It's not a tutorial, just an overview
going in enough detail to understand Sharpmake advantages.


## Installation and documentation

Please refer to [OVERVIEW.md](docs/OVERVIEW.md) for an in-depth documentation about Sharpmake. You
